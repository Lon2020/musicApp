# musicApp

I do the login, registration and log out function. 
This application is based on back4app cloud service, and Parse SDK. 
To implement this, first, I install the Parse SDK in the Xcode, using CocoaPods as dependency manager, 
I can easily add this dependency by type some commands and edit some config files. 
The key step here is to connect the local app to the cloud service, so I create a back4app account, 
and connect to my server using application id and clientKey. After that, the data will upload to server properly.

Here is the image of the database.
